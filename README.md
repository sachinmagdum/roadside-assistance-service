# Roadside Assistance Service - Developer Instructions

This README provides instructions on how to build and execute tests for the Roadside Assistance Service implementation. The service is responsible for connecting customers with nearby service providers using a REST API.

## Assumptions and Considerations:

* The RoadsideAssistanceService implementation assumes that an in-memory storage for spatial and reservation data is suitable for the current
assignment. However, it is explicitly noted that the system will eventually require integration with a
persistence storage solution that supports geo-spatial data for efficient assistant location mapping.
* Efficient retrieval of geospatial data for finding nearby assistants will be critical in a production system,
and the class should eventually utilize spatial indexing and geospatial database solutions.
* The `AssistantManager` and `ReservationManager` are used to manage assistant locations and reservations.
* The `Synchronized` annotation is used for methods that may be accessed concurrently to ensure thread safety in
a single-server environment. However, in a multi-server environment, additional database-level handling is
required to guarantee thread safety and data consistency.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have Java JDK 8 or later installed on your system.

2. **Maven**: Make sure you have Apache Maven installed to build and manage dependencies.

3. **JUnit**: JUnit is required for running the test cases.

## Building the Project

1. Clone the project from the GitHub repository using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sachinmagdum/roadside-assistance-service.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd roadside-assistance-service
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This command will download dependencies and compile the project.

## Running Tests

After building the project, you can run the tests using the following command:

```shell
mvn test
```

This command will execute the test cases, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.

## Test Coverage

The tests include unit tests for the core components of the Roadside Assistance Service, including the `RoadsideAssistanceServiceImpl`, `AssistantManager`, `ReservationManager`, and a few internal classes. You can view the test classes in the `src/test` directory.

## Test Results

After running the tests, you can view the test results in the console. Successful tests will show a "PASS" message, and any failures or errors will be reported.

## Test Customization

You can customize the test scenarios by modifying the test classes or adding additional test cases. Make sure to adhere to best practices in testing, including arranging, acting, and asserting your tests.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the project's dependencies are correctly configured in the `pom.xml` file.
- You can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for a more user-friendly testing experience.
